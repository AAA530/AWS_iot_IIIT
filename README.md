# AWS_iot_IIIT

we are using linkit one as micro-controller.

This code publishes message to topic='dhairya' on aws iot core
you have to store data recevied to dyanamodb or any other database

# JSON_to_TOPIC
This code sends data to aws iot topic="dhairya" in json format, and now we are able to get that data on dynamodb.
we now have to retrive data from data base and show on a website
